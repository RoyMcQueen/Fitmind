Since I'm rather introverted anyway, I wouldn't be randomly talking with people at a party.  The way it was described seems the most awkward.  People are having fun around you and you walk up to someone with something you have no idea if they'd be interested in.  Someone like me would scope out people and their personalities prior or wait for an opportunity to fit my way into the conversation.  If I only did know my friend as well, chances are I'd hang with him when possible and he'd help me meet up with people."
I must not be good at persuading people.

I must not be very likeable.
sadness
My friends don't like me
I was told again that the position was filled and it wasn't for me.

She didn't comprehend it before and wouldn't comprehend it now. I'd be completely unable to rest. I'd have to be around her for 24/7.

I got fired and dont have income coming into my household now

because family is forever but the job pays very well
"I would have to move somewhere else, change my life and lose friends"
I felt invisible
being alone
Probably leave the party and cry in my car
I wouldn't have anything to say.
"Move on, continue a friendship with this person"
There's nothing special about me.
Finding another job is a lot of work and means a lot of uncertainty.
It would mean I need to find the correct way to fix his behavior so that he does what he's supposed to do. 
I think it would say I was self aware and was able to  see the event from multiple perspectives. 
I am eating poorly and not exercising enough
"Last week, I went to the store and when I was pulling into a parking spot, another car went for the same spot at the same time and we almost ran into each other; I got incredibly aggravated at the guy and it was on my mind for the entire duration at the store and all day after."

Keep walking.
I will not get promoted.

It would say that I am a lowlife and he is better than me.
Ask the person if they were upset with me about something.
"It means it is time to move on because they were never really invested in the first place. It could reflect poorly on my emotional availability, but this is speculative."
I might not be able to find another girlfriend.
I will experience joblessness and will be financially unstable.
I want people to like me and it would bother me if people did not want to spend time with me and be my friend. 
i will try to convince her and get back her in my life.
Try as hard as I could to find a job in a different kind of setting.

"I will possibly lose my job, or not receive a promotion that I would otherwise get if I had tried harder."
disappointed
The next jobs I do I will do better and I learned something from this situation.
I am not a good salesman
I'd know I'm a failure and would waste money on another college course.
"IF THEY CONSIDER ME AS THEIR CLOSE FRIEND , THEY WOULD DEFINITELY COME WITH ME FOR OUT."
I could start thinking of finding another job.
I would be annoyed that my boss did not have faith in me.

guilty
sad
"I'm a poor communicator and have failed to adequetly express myself in a manner that conveyed the meaning I intended (I meant \not right now,\\ not \\""never\\"")\"""""

angry
I am not good enough.

I would continue being friendly at work but wouldn't try to take the relationship any further. 
"I fussed at my teenage daughter for some chores she had failed to do, even though she had done a ton of other work that day and really should've been praised rather than criticized.  "
I will try to reduce my work
I would get an unbiased opinion on my attractiveness and then fix what I could.
Confront the person the next time in person.
I feel like they were just saying that because I was on break.
I am walking down the street and see an acquaintance I like.  I wave to him but get no response back.
dedicate my time to the work
I would ignore the person the next time I see him at a social gathering and probably tell some friends about the incident to ease my pain. 
My family is hurt because I want to postpone their visit because I would be too busy around that time.
They need to deal with it and reschedule the visit.

I have no worth.

SO walked out on me.
"I was hungry, so I went to the kitchen to dinner and my sister's boyfriend was there. I don't like him. "
I invited them out and they didn't want to go out with me. 
I would try to find out what I did wrong and how to remedy it.
"I showed a new game idea I have to some friends I have in a chat room we all have together, but only 2 of them responded."

They'll tell other people how dull they think I am.
I have no job and am worried about finding one I can do well. 
anxious
"I'm not sure why she doesn't like me, and the friendliness is unrequited."
Embarrassment 
I found out I didn't get a job that i had tried for. This was the 3rd time that this had happened to me.
That they don't really like me
sadness
Working very hard
My co-worker doesn't like me and might tell others at work.
This was the only situation where I actually felt like I had a chance of making friends. There will be no other chances.
I am not doing enough to keep his attention.
Spend time by myself trying new things.
I will be lonely.
I would be boring to other people
I'd take a break or listen to some music and try again in a little while. 
I am just the kind of person who will never make friends.
Hurt
I would write bulletin points down of topics and start brainstorming ways to start creating my essay.
nothing
I may not be able to restore my marriage.
It would mean I'm a good person
Because I wasn't given any reason as to why I was unable to write any sentences.  Am I just stupid? Do I not know what my main assignment was that I had to write an essay to begin with?  Do I know what I'm supposed to write about but haven't because I haven't looked up any information about the topic?  I'm confused because this scenario is quite bad.
Leave the party

I would try to keep up with the diet and give it more time to fully take affect

I go to pick him up on the agreed time and date, only to find he was not even ready to go. Apparently, he pushed his travel date back and just forgot to tell me. I was livid, considering I had cleared up my schedule to attend to his needs."
Because it means someone I care about doesn't value my friendship.
I am walking on the street and see an acquaintance from work. I wave at him but get no response.
I'm not going to be able to help him learn how to get by in life
pissed
I would look in to other job opportunities that I might be better suited for. 
I have again lost out on a job to someone else. I am beginning to feel concerned and frustrated as this is the third time I received a similar call this week. 
I must have given him a reason to stop speaking to me.  Maybe he thinks I am mean.
It would mean that I should give up and just find a job and die lonely.
annoyed
anger
"I have wasted time, education, and money on something I am not good at."
People are not going to enjoy being around me
I'm not smart enough for this class
"While I was on a coffee break, my boss stopped by to remind that their is still work to be done. "
"I was waiting in line at a gas station, and was blocking the lane in the parking lot.  When a minivan came along and tried to legally drive through that same parking lot, I got really angry at the driver of that van, and just left the station in disgust. "
It means exactly what im saying. That i want to be heard.  
"I just continued to be there for them in planning the funeral and what not, and continued to try to put a smile on their face."
That I applied several places and had no success in finding a new job.

I would get feedback from the employers and ask them what they would 've liked to see ie. additional training
surprised
I am not a likeable person.
Scoff and get a drink.
It would make me feel further behind and in the hole
Demonstrate that I don't need to be told these things.
Does nobody want to talk to me?
Maybe this means that I am evil as money is the root of evil
Seek out a doctor or professional to help me figure out how to lose weight 
"I would have to find another job, in a different profession"
Get up and walk away from it for a while. Maybe look up information for inspiration.
I was wasting my time and I'm a disappointment.
loneliness
I don't know anybody else here
To avoid that I would say nothing and the relationship would stagnate in misery.
My wife might leave me.
nothing
Did this person have to be rude. Was it that hard to wave back
I hate myself
They don't like me as much as I like them.
The person doesn't remember who I am.
I came home and noticed that my wife has packed all of her things and left. There is a note on the table saying that it was inevitable and that I need to accept that this is reality.
I will always be this size.
I'd keep going with my diet.
"If she did die, I would try to comfort my mother."
I should have been trained better.
I can't do anything right. There's something wrong with my body.
"Try to become more interesting, maybe?"
i could not be able to provide food for the kids

I would stop focusing on what is important.
That I make poor decisions 
I will be alone
I should have known better
I will die lonely
Fear
I would try to find employment somewhere not in sales.
I'd make sure my boss doesn't see me on breaks. I'd leave the office. I'd also stay on top of my work time-wise.
I received a phone call telling me I didn't get a job.
"My mother will threaten to cut off the financial help she provides for her grandkids, despite the fact that I was the one who asked them not to come, not my kids. "
My lover has left me by leaving a note for me to find.
That person probably just has different taste in conversation or a specific objective on their mind that I'm intruding on.
I might fail the course.
my partner moved out and ended our relationship
fear
I became very stressed out after getting a bad score on a quiz
rejection

sad
I get to keep to myself. 
Forget about her and move on to the next person
i was fired from my job for not meeting my quota
I can't fight and must surrender.
"I would try to work with my manager to see if they'd give me another shot, otherwise I would take unemployment courses on how to be a better salesperson and look for another job."
I am not interesting enough for him.
I wouldn't do anything. 
"It might mean that they heard something about me that they didn't like, and I would worry about what it is."
guilt
"I found a job I thought was perfect for me in the field I used to work in and love very much. A few days after putting in a resume and lining up several references, I found out the job was filled and I didn't even get so much as an acknowledgment of my application much less an interview when I was extremely qualified."
I'm not capable of achieving goals.
"In future I won't try to do things irresponsibly or possibly unsafe, even if it's only temporary and/or I think no one will notice"

I would ensure I was following the diet closely and remind myself that weight fluctuates week to week and that's ok
"My husband could've gotten a DUI or killed someone with his drunk driving, or I could've flew into a blind rage at my husband or the other woman for cheating on me. It would mean that I am a jealous person or married to an idiot."

frustrated
They should have trained me better.
My money was stolen. 
I am trying to reduce my weight by following many diets. But I can't follow more than a week. At the end of the week I gained one pound in my weight.
I may not be able to graduate.

disappointed
interviewed for a job with a new company but received a voicemail later in the week they chose to go with another candidate
